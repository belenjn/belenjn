<h1 align='center'>Hi, my name is Belén 👋</h1>
<p align="justify">

🪞<a href="www.belenjn.com"> Check my website here</a>

👶🏻 One year ago I decided to renew myself and started studying programming.

🗯️ After some research, I realized that I liked Front-End Dev. 

🖌️ I started studying HTML, CSS, Javascript and later React.
  
🎓 I studied Front-end Development in a Samsung course. Dedicated to women only.

📝 I studied Full Stack Development at Oxygen Academy too.

🙏🏻 I would like to be able to start working to consolidate knowledge, meet a team and work with them, learn from the people who form it and start gaining experience in this sector.
