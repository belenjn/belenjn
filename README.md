<h1 align='center'>Hi, my name is Belén 👋</h1>

<p align="justify">


👧🏻 I really like programming and also creating designs, taking into account the user experience, so that the whole (design + functionalities) is the best possible. In this way, I can embody my creativity. I like to fight for my goals and achieve them.

📝 I have completed the Full Stack Development training at Oxygen Academy and I continue to train myself in a self-taught way.

🏠 I am open to remote or on-site job offers (Galicia).
