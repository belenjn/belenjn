👶🏻 One year ago I decided to renew myself and started studying programming.

🗯️ After some research, I realized that I liked Front-End Dev. 

🖌️ I started studying HTML, CSS, Javascript and later React.
  
🎓 I studied Front-end Development in a Samsung course. Dedicated to women only.

📝 I'm currently studying Full Stack Development at Oxygen Academy.

📌 Here I leave the link of my first project (which has the repo on my profile): 👉🏻 https://belenjn.github.io/star-wars-app/ 👈🏻
